# mana-signals

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

A computational engine with reactive values for real-time processing of
the data.

## Install

``` sh
pip install git+https://github.com/jstranik/mana-signals.git
```

## How to use

The package contains a library for processing market data and making
signal generators.

Documentation of the library is avaialble at
https://jstranik.github.io/mana-signals/reactive.html

However here is a small teaser:

``` python
a = RInput(0)
v = RLastn(a, 3)
for i in range(5): 
    print(v.value)
    a.set_value(i)
```

    [ 0. nan nan]
    [ 0.  0. nan]
    [1. 0. 0.]
    [2. 1. 0.]
    [3. 2. 1.]

Above example shows a reactive primite RLastn which collect last 3
values of the data. The reactive values recalculate on demand when an
input is change. Therefore accessing `v.value` mutliple times does not
trigger recalculation unless `a` is changed.

## Demo script

The package contain a simple demo application (available in demo module)
which processes market data and on every tick prints a mean market
volatility across symbols.

The demo app can be invoked as:

> \$\> simulate_signal_processing ../marketdata/20230601.MATIC.csv.gz

The application will print in realtime to the console actual market
volatility on every market input.
